# Employee Turnover Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project, developed by Daria and Shachar, is centered around predicting employee turnover. Using machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify the likelihood of employees leaving the company based on various attributes. The goal is to maximize the F1 score, a critical metric in evaluating classification models.

## Data Overview
Our dataset includes details of 3722 employees, featuring attributes such as Education, Joining Year, City, Payment Tier, Age, Gender, EverBenched, Experience in Current Domain, and Race. The target variable is 'LeaveOrNot'.

## Approach
We used several preprocessing techniques and algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Boosting, Bagging, and ensemble methods. The project's Jupyter notebook details our methodology and the steps taken.

## Metrics
We evaluated our model using AUC, ROC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Accuracy. These metrics are detailed in our project presentation.

## Repository Contents
- Several `ipynb`files containing project notebooks of EDA and the classification pipeline and analysis.
- Datasets
- Test folder containing test scripts and predictions
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions.
